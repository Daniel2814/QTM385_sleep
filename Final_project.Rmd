Optional: Grouped Mean Imputation (e.g., by chronotype)
If you want more targeted imputation:

```{r}

library(sandwich)
library(lmtest)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

data <- read.csv("/Users/danielnickas/Downloads/QTM385_sleep/08-exercise-regimen.csv")
```

# Step 3: Mean Imputation for Numeric Variables
```{r}
numeric_vars <- sapply(data, is.numeric)

for (col in names(data)[numeric_vars]) {
  data[[col]][is.na(data[[col]])] <- mean(data[[col]], na.rm = TRUE)
}

# Step 4: Primary Outcome – TST (Total Sleep Time)
# =======================
model_tst <- lm(tst_post ~ treatment_group + tst_baseline + sex + chronotype +
                  sleep_env_quality + alcohol_drug_use,
                data = data)

cat("=== Primary Outcome: TST ===\n")
coeftest(model_tst, vcov = vcovHC(model_tst, type = "HC1"))
```
Primary Outcome: Total Sleep Time (TST) — ITT Regression Summary
✅ Exercise group slept ~21 minutes more than control (p < 0.001) — statistically significant effect

📈 Baseline sleep predicts post-intervention sleep (0.82 min increase per 1 min at baseline, p < 0.001)

🕒 Chronotype:

Intermediate types: +17 min vs. evening (p = 0.048)

Morning types: +22 min vs. evening (p = 0.029)

⚠️ Alcohol/drug use: Users slept ~15 min less than non-users (p = 0.033)

👤 Sex effects:

Male: ~4 min less than female (not significant)

Other/NB: ~26 min less (marginally significant, p = 0.069)

🛏️ Sleep environment quality: small positive effect (+1.5 min), not significant


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
# Step 5: Secondary Outcomes
# =======================

# Sleep Latency
model_latency <- lm(latency_post ~ treatment_group + latency_baseline + sex + chronotype +
                      sleep_env_quality + alcohol_drug_use,
                    data = data)
cat("\n=== Secondary Outcome: Sleep Latency ===\n")
coeftest(model_latency, vcov = vcovHC(model_latency, type = "HC1"))
```
⏱️ Secondary Outcome: Sleep Latency
✅ Exercise group fell asleep ~3.6 minutes faster than control (p < 0.001) — significant improvement

📈 Baseline sleep latency strongly predicts outcome (0.81 min increase per 1 min at baseline, p < 0.001)

👤 Sex (Other/NB): Slept ~5.2 min slower than females (p = 0.006) — significant

Other predictors not significant:

Sex (Male): +1.3 min (p = 0.16)

Chronotype: not significant

Sleep environment: negligible

Alcohol/drug use: no significant effect

```{r}
# WASO
model_waso <- lm(waso_post ~ treatment_group + waso_baseline + sex + chronotype +
                   sleep_env_quality + alcohol_drug_use,
                 data = data)
cat("\n=== Secondary Outcome: WASO ===\n")
coeftest(model_waso, vcov = vcovHC(model_waso, type = "HC1"))
```
Here’s your concise bullet-point summary for the regression on Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO):

🌙 Secondary Outcome: WASO
✅ Exercise group spent ~9.6 fewer minutes awake after falling asleep (p < 0.001) — statistically significant improvement

📈 Baseline WASO is highly predictive of post-intervention WASO (0.79 min per 1 min baseline, p < 0.001)

All other predictors were not statistically significant, including:

Sex (Male or Other/NB)

Chronotype

Sleep environment quality

Alcohol/drug use

The result supports your hypothesis: exercise significantly reduces nighttime wakefulness, with a sizable effect.

```{r}
# Sleep Efficiency
model_efficiency <- lm(efficiency_post ~ treatment_group + efficiency_baseline + sex + chronotype +
                         sleep_env_quality + alcohol_drug_use,
                       data = data)
cat("\n=== Secondary Outcome: Sleep Efficiency ===\n")
coeftest(model_efficiency, vcov = vcovHC(model_efficiency, type = "HC1"))

# Number of Awakenings
model_awakenings <- lm(awakenings_post ~ treatment_group + awakenings_baseline + sex + chronotype +
                         sleep_env_quality + alcohol_drug_use,
                       data = data)
cat("\n=== Secondary Outcome: Number of Awakenings ===\n")
coeftest(model_awakenings, vcov = vcovHC(model_awakenings, type = "HC1"))
```

🟩 Secondary Outcome: Sleep Efficiency
✅ Exercise group had +3.5 percentage point higher efficiency compared to control (p < 0.001) — statistically significant and meaningful

📈 Baseline efficiency strongly predicts outcome (β = 0.74, p < 0.001)

All other covariates (sex, chronotype, sleep environment, alcohol/drugs) were not statistically significant

🔁 Secondary Outcome: Number of Awakenings
✅ Exercise group experienced ~0.42 fewer awakenings per night (p < 0.001) — significant improvement

📈 Strong baseline effect: previous awakening counts predict future awakenings (β = 0.95, p < 0.001)

All other covariates showed no significant effects

# Step 6: Moderation Effects
# =======================

# Interaction: Treatment × Chronotype
model_interaction_chronotype <- lm(tst_post ~ treatment_group * chronotype + tst_baseline +
                                     sex + sleep_env_quality + alcohol_drug_use,
                                   data = data)
cat("\n=== Interaction: Treatment × Chronotype ===\n")
coeftest(model_interaction_chronotype, vcov = vcovHC(model_interaction_chronotype, type = "HC1"))

# Interaction: Treatment × Sleep Environment
model_interaction_env <- lm(tst_post ~ treatment_group * sleep_env_quality + tst_baseline +
                              sex + chronotype + alcohol_drug_use,
                            data = data)
cat("\n=== Interaction: Treatment × Sleep Environment Quality ===\n")
coeftest(model_interaction_env, vcov = vcovHC(model_interaction_env, type = "HC1"))

# Interaction: Treatment × Alcohol/Drug Use
model_interaction_alcohol <- lm(tst_post ~ treatment_group * alcohol_drug_use + tst_baseline +
                                  sex + chronotype + sleep_env_quality,
                                data = data)
cat("\n=== Interaction: Treatment × Alcohol/Drug Use ===\n")
coeftest(model_interaction_alcohol, vcov = vcovHC(model_interaction_alcohol, type = "HC1"))
```

🔀 Interaction: Treatment × Chronotype
Exercise was most effective for Morning types:

treatment_group:chronotypeMorning = +35.3 minutes, marginally significant (p = 0.070)

Intermediate types showed no significant moderation

🧠 Interpretation: Contrary to your hypothesis, morning types may benefit more than evening types

✅ Main effect of tst_baseline and alcohol/drug use still strong and significant

🌿 Interaction: Treatment × Sleep Environment Quality
Interaction term (treatment_group:sleep_env_quality) = not significant (p = 0.56)

Suggests no meaningful moderation by sleep environment quality

🧠 Interpretation: Exercise’s effect on TST appears consistent across different sleep environments

🍷 Interaction: Treatment × Alcohol/Drug Use
treatment_group:alcohol_drug_use = –21.1 minutes (p = 0.117) — not statistically significant, but large and directionally consistent

🧠 Interpretation: Participants who reported frequent alcohol/drug use may benefit less from exercise — supports hypothesis, but needs more power to confirm
